# Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
Recommendation systems help users discover relevant items based on past interactions.
The objective of this project is to build an item-based collaborative filtering recommendation system that recommends items similar to a given item based on user rating behavior.

## Dataset
Publicly available user–item ratings dataset.
The dataset represents user preferences for items and is commonly used for building recommendation systems.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Construction of user–item interaction matrix
- Computation of item–item similarity using cosine similarity
- Recommendation generation based on similar items
- Analysis of similarity scores and recommendations

## Evaluation
- Qualitative evaluation of recommended items
- Manual inspection of similarity results
- Understanding recommendation relevance

## Key Insights
- Item-based collaborative filtering provides stable recommendations
- Item similarity captures collective user preference patterns
- Item-based methods scale better than user-based approaches
- Sparsity in user–item interactions is a key challenge

## Limitations
- Cold-start problem for new items
- Does not capture changing user preferences over time
- Limited diversity in recommendations
